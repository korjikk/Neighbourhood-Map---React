# Neighbourhood-Map---React
**A neighbourhood map, created using create-react-app, Google Maps API and Wikipedia API.**

# How to run:
1. Install all dependencies executing the "npm install" command.
2. Create the build executing the "npm run build" command.
3. Run the application executing the "serve -s build" command.

**Note**: Be sure to have the latest versions of npm and Node.js installed.

**Note**: This application uses the integrated Service Worker from the create-react-app. It doesn't work in development environment, so, in order for it to work, you should do the build, and not just use npm start. (Reffer to the steps above).

#Used API's
1. **Google Maps API**, do display the map, markers and infowindows.
2. **Wikipedia API**, to fetch the location details
